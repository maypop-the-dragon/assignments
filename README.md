# May's Class Assignments

I probably want to get a job at some point so I thought, since I haven't
finished a real project, it might be good to at *least* put my class assignments
online, so that's what this repo is for.

I am not exactly new to programming, so with each assignment, I tried to
challenge myself or at least do something creative.
