Complete #1, #2 or #3, Remember to name files descriptively, complete the
Critical Thinking first before coding, upload the Critical Thinking, the .cpp
files, and a picture of the outputs.

1. String Length
  - Write a function that returns an integer and accepts a pointer to a C-string
    as an argument. The function should count the number of characters in the
    string and return that number. Demonstrate the function in a simple program
    that asks the user to input a string, passes it to the function, then
    displays the function’s return value.
2. Backward String
  - Write a function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as an argument and
    displays its contents backward. For instance, if the string argument is ""
    the function should display "". Demonstrate the function in a program that
    asks the user to input a string then passes it to the function.
3. Word Counter
  - Write a function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as an argument and
    returns the number of words contained in the string. For instance, if the
    string argument is “Four score and seven years ago” the function should
    return the number 6. Demonstrate the function in a program that asks the
    user to input a string then passes it to the function. The number of words
    in the string should be displayed on the screen. Optional Exercise: Write an overloaded version of this function
    that accepts a string class object as its argument.
