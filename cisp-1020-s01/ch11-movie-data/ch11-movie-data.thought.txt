I picked this one because I thought I could have some fun with it by making the
output look like one of those marquee thingies using control codes.

I feel like the instructions for the assignment lay out how the program should
work pretty well, so I won't be super detailed on that, except that I will
actually put the movie data structures into an array instead of two separate
variables so that you could theoretically add more movies later. All the movies
will be displayed on the same marquee, so the entire array will be passed.

Yeah, I wrote the program without thinking everything through again. I find it
kind of tedious to plan without being able to experiment while doing so, plus
this particular one needed a lot of tweaking to make the design look good. The
program is slightly worse for it. I could rewrite it to be better with the
insights I have gained from my mistakes but I don't feel like doing that now.

For the movies, I chose "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" because it's a classic
and "Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the
Terror" because its title is very long to demonstrate the text wrapping
functionality I added.
