Complete #1 and #2 or #1 and #3, Remember to name files descriptively, complete
the Critical Thinking first before coding, upload the Critical Thinking, the
.cpp files, and a picture of the outputs.

1. Employee and ProductionWorker Classes
  - Design a class named Employee.
    The class should keep the following information:
    1. Employee name
    2. Employee number
    3. Hire date

  - Write one or more constructors, and the appropriate accessor
    and mutator functions, for the class.

  - Next, write a class named ProductionWorker that is derived from the Employee
    class. The ProductionWorker class should have member variables to hold the
    following information:
    1. Shift (an integer)
    2. Hourly pay rate (a double)

  - The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night.
    The shift variable will hold an integer value representing the shift that
    the employee works. The day shift is shift 1, and the night shift
    is shift 2. Write one or more constructors, and the appropriate accessor and
    mutator functions, for the class. Demonstrate the classes by writing a
    program that uses a ProductionWorker object.

2. ShiftSupervisor Class
  - In a particular factory, a shift supervisor is a salaried employee who
    supervises a shift. In addition to a salary, the shift supervisor earns a
    yearly bonus when his or her shift meets production goals. Design a
    ShiftSupervisor class that is derived from the Employee class you created in
    Programming Challenge 1 (Employee and Production Worker Classes). The
    ShiftSupervisor class should have a member variable that holds the annual
    salary, and a member variable that holds the annual production bonus that a
    shift supervisor has earned. Write one or more constructors and the
    appropriate accessor and mutator functions for the class.
    Demonstrate the class by writing a program that uses a ShiftSupervisor
    object.

3. TeamLeader Class
  - In a particular factory, a team leader is an hourly paid production worker
    who leads a small team. In addition to hourly pay, team leaders earn a fixed
    monthly bonus. Team leaders are required to attend a minimum number of hours
    of training per year. Design a TeamLeader class that extends the
    ProductionWorker class you designed in Programming Challenge 1 (Employee and
    Production Worker Classes). The TeamLeader class should have member
    variables for the monthly bonus amount, the required number of training
    hours, and the number of training hours that the team leader has attended.
    Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator
    functions for the class. Demonstrate the class by writing a program that
    uses a TeamLeader object.
