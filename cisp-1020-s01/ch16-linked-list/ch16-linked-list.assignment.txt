Complete #1 and #2 extra credit for #3, Remember to name files descriptively,
complete the Critical Thinking first before coding, upload the Critical
Thinking, the .cpp files, and a picture of the outputs.

1. Your Own Linked List

   Design your own linked list class to hold a series of integers.
   The class should have member functions for appending, inserting,
   and deleting nodes.
   Donâ€™t forget to add a destructor that destroys the list.
   Demonstrate the class with a driver program.

2. List Print
   
   Modify the linked list class you created in Programming Challenge 1 to add
   a print member function. The function should display all the values in the
   linked list. Test the class by starting with an empty list, adding some
   elements, then printing the resulting list out.

Extra Credit:

3. List Copy Constructor

   Modify your linked list class of Programming Challenges 1 and 2 to add a
   copy constructor. Test your class by making a list, making a copy of the
   list, then displaying the values in the copy.
